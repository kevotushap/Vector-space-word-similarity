#Project: Natural Language Processing Assignment

Description:
This project involves analyzing text data using natural language processing techniques. The tasks include building term-document and term-context matrices, applying weighting schemes, analyzing associations between words, and examining potential social biases in the data.

Environment:
- Python 3.8.10
- Required Packages: scipy, numpy

Usage:
1. Download or clone the project repository.
2. Ensure Python 3.8.10 is installed on your system.
3. Install the required packages.
4. Run the Python scripts(.py)to execute the code.

Resources:
1. Skeleton Python code: This code provides a starting point for the assignment and contains stubs for some functions that need to be implemented.

2. CSV of the complete works of Shakespeare: This file contains the complete works of Shakespeare in CSV format. Each row represents a line from a play, with columns for play name, line number, character name, and the actual line.

3. Vocab of the complete works of Shakespeare: This file contains the vocabulary extracted from the complete works of Shakespeare.

4. List of all plays in the dataset: This file contains a list of all the plays included in the Shakespeare dataset.

5. SNLI corpus: This corpus contains selections from the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset, which is used for the NLP task of natural language inference. Each line in the corpus contains a sentence that is either a premise (an image caption) or a hypothesis produced by annotators to be in a certain logical relation with the associated premise (entailment, neutral, contradiction). The sentenceID column is a unique index for each sentence, and captionID is an ID for all sentences associated with the same caption/premise.

6. List of identity labels from Rudinger et al. 2017: This file contains a list of identity labels that can be used for analyzing social biases in the SNLI corpus.
